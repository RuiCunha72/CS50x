1.

Calculate the average of each value: energy, valence, and danceability
Since the AURA represents two moods, pick the two averages that are the furthest from 0.5 (the most extreme values)
Possible scenario:
    AVG(energy) = 0.74 <---
    AVG(valence) = 0.32 <---
    AVG(danceability) = 0.55
The two most extreme averages are energy and valence
Since AVG(energy) > 0.5 we can say the listener enjoys energetic songs
Since AVG(valence) < 0.5 we can say the listener tends to prefer more melancholic songs
Thus, the listener's mood would be energetic and melancholic (not the best example since it sounds a bit contradictory ;--;)


2. 

Maybe the listener spends more time listening to their top 25% most played songs and that could be a better representation of their mood
To do this we could apply the same logic as in point 1, but restricted only to that top segment
